Solution Flag: ISM_FLAG_AES_IS_THE_BEST

Method:
1. The user should download the mp3 audio file

2. The user should find the AES key, a text hidden in the audio file
(I used https://www.stegonaut.com/ to hide the key)

3. The user should decipher the AES message with the key and get the flag
(I used https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ to encrypt the flag, the message is 
encoded in base64 and the user should realize that for the decryption)
