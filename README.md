# Self_Create_Capture_The_Flag
This repository hosts a personally designed Capture The Flag competition that incorporates a unique blend of cryptography and steganography challenges. The CTF consists of two main tasks rooted in the Enigma and AES encryption techniques. Participants must demonstrate their understanding of these encryption standards, along with their ability to solve complex problems. The solutions are ingeniously hidden using picture and audio steganography, requiring an exploration of data hiding techniques to uncover the answers. This project aims to offer an engaging platform for sharpening one's skills in the cryptographic and steganographic domains while stimulating critical and out-of-the-box thinking.
