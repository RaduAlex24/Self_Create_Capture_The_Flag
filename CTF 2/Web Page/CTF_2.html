			AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that uses 
			a fixed length key to encrypt and decrypt data. It is a block cipher, meaning that it encrypts data in 
			fixed size blocks, rather than encrypting one bit at a time like a stream cipher. AES is considered to be
			very secure and is used in a variety of applications, including encrypting data transmitted over networks
			and secure communications. The key size for AES can be 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits, with the longer 
			key sizes providing stronger encryption.

			AES is a variant of the Rijndael cipher, a block cipher that was developed by Belgian cryptographers 
			Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. It was chosen as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) by the US National
			Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001, after a public competition, and it is widely used as
			a standard for secure communication.
